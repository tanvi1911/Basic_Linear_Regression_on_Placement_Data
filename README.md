# Basic_Linear_Regression_on_Placement_Data
In this Python notebook, I've conducted a basic linear regression analysis using the scikit-learn library on a dataset that contains information about student placements. The dataset includes two key columns, namely CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and Package.

This repository contains a python notebook that demonstrates a basic linear regression analysis for predicting placement packages based on CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). The notebook provides a step-by-step explanation of data preparation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Introduction

In this notebook, we explore the application of linear regression in predicting placement packages of students based on their CGPA scores. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous target variables based on one or more predictor variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about students' CGPA and their corresponding placement packages. The goal is to build a linear regression model that can predict placement packages based on CGPA scores.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: We start by loading the dataset and exploring its structure and content.

2. **Data Visualization**: Visualization techniques are used to understand the relationship between CGPA and placement packages.

3. **Linear Regression Modeling**: We apply linear regression to create a predictive model.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using various regression evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) Score, and Adjusted R-squared Score.

## Dependencies

This notebook uses Python and several libraries, including:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install these dependencies using `pip` if they are not already installed.
